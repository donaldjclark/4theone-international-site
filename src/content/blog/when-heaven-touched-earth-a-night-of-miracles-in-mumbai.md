There are moments in ministry that mark us forever—and this night in Mumbai was one of them. What began as a simple time of worship quickly became a collision point between heaven and earth. We watched as the Spirit of God moved with undeniable power, healing bodies, restoring hearts, and setting captives free. It wasn’t a conference, it wasn’t a crusade—it was a divine visitation.

People poured in from every corner of the city. A tangible hunger filled the room. As we lifted up the name of Jesus, the atmosphere shifted. Deaf ears popped open. Tumors disappeared. A woman confined to a wheelchair for seven years walked for the first time. No hype. No striving. Just His presence.

What makes revival authentic isn’t the manifestations—it’s the fruit. That night, dozens surrendered their lives to Christ. Families were reconciled. Local pastors testified to long-awaited breakthroughs in their churches. This wasn’t a moment—it was a spark. And we believe it will ignite a sustained move of God across South Asia.

Revival isn’t coming—it’s here. And it’s personal. May we never get too familiar with the supernatural that we forget to be in awe of the One behind it all.
