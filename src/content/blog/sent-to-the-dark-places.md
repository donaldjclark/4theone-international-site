**“God sends us to the dark, scary places.”** It’s not just a slogan—it’s our reality.

We were never called to play it safe. Jesus didn’t commission us to stay in our comfort zones. He sent us _to the ends of the earth._ And that’s exactly where we’ve been going—into the slums of Cambodia, the villages of Pakistan, and even into war-torn nations we can’t mention online. Wherever the light of Jesus is needed most, that’s where He sends us.

## Fire in the Dark

Over this past year, we’ve traveled to more than **thirteen nations**, carrying the love and power of Jesus. We’ve seen **hundreds come to Christ**—in remote villages, bustling cities, and places where the gospel had rarely been heard. We’ve witnessed healings, deliverance from oppression, and whole communities transformed by the simple, life-changing message of the Father’s love.

But more than the miracles, what moves us most is seeing people fall in love with **Jesus Himself.** Not just what He can do, but who He is.

## The Mission Field Is a Posture

> “The mission field isn’t a place—it’s a posture.”

It’s the daily choice to say _yes to love,_ _yes to risk,_ and _yes to the Great Commission._ One pastor jokingly calls us “wonder women,” because we keep going where most people tell us not to go. But the truth is—we’re not superheroes. We’re ordinary believers with a burning heart and a simple message: **Jesus loves and Jesus saves.**

## The Harvest Is Ripe

And He’s still sending.

If you’ve felt that tug in your heart—the burden, the stirring, the fire in your bones—this is your invitation. The same God who called us is calling you too. The harvest is ripe.

**Let’s go.**
