We were never called to play it safe. Jesus didn’t commission us to comfort zones—He sent us to the ends of the earth. And that’s exactly where we’ve been going. From the slums of India to the mountains of South America, our teams are carrying fire where it’s needed most.

In the last three months, we’ve seen hundreds come to Christ in remote villages. We’ve witnessed blind eyes opened, demonic oppression broken, and communities transformed by the simple gospel. But more than that—we’ve seen people fall in love with Jesus, not just His miracles.

The mission field isn’t a place—it’s a posture. It’s the daily choice to say yes to love, yes to risk, and yes to the Great Commission. Our teams aren’t superheroes. They’re ordinary believers with a burning heart and a simple message: Jesus saves.

And He’s still sending. If you’ve felt the nudge, the burden, the fire in your bones—this is your invitation. The harvest is ripe. Let’s go.
