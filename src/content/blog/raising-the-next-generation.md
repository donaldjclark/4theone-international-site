There’s a burning in our hearts for the next generation—not just to see them survive, but to see them lead in power and purity. We believe God is raising up children and youth who will know His voice, walk in boldness, and carry the fire of revival wherever they go.

In our recent youth gatherings, we’ve watched the Holy Spirit fall on young people with such intensity, it’s undone us. Kids are prophesying. Teenagers are laying hands on the sick and seeing them recover. They’re not waiting for permission—they’re stepping into purpose now.

But they need guidance. They need spiritual mothers and fathers to walk with them, to nurture what’s blooming. This generation doesn’t want religion—they want reality. They want to encounter the living God, not just hear about Him. And it’s our joy to create spaces where that can happen safely and supernaturally.

The next wave of revival isn’t coming from pulpits—it’s coming from bedrooms, lunch tables, and locker rooms. And we say yes to shepherding them into the fullness of their calling.
