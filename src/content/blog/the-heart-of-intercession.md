In the secret place of prayer, nations are shifted and destinies are birthed. Intercession is not for the elite—it’s the inheritance of every believer. At 4theOne, we’ve been contending for the presence of God to flood the earth through the furnace of intercession. It’s not glamorous, but it’s glorious.

Each week, we gather with one agenda: to hear what’s on heaven’s heart and pray it into reality. We’ve seen hardened regions soften, spiritual atmospheres shift, and breakthrough explode out of quiet obedience. These moments have reminded us that revival isn’t sustained on stages—it’s sustained on our knees.

There’s something sacred about becoming a friend of God—someone He trusts to carry His burdens and release His heart. Intercessors don’t just react to the news; they shape it. They see beyond the natural and call down what is unseen into reality. This is the kind of company we long to build: laid-down lovers who pray without ceasing, not from fear, but from fullness.

We believe history belongs to the intercessors. And as we lean in together, we’re convinced: there is no ceiling to what God will do through a praying people.
