The prophetic isn’t a side ministry—it’s the inheritance of every believer. To hear God’s voice is to walk in friendship with Him. At 4theOne, we’ve seen how prophetic ministry opens hearts, aligns destinies, and breaks through impossibilities with clarity and compassion.

In a recent outreach, one of our team members received a word of knowledge for a woman who had just lost her job and was contemplating suicide. That single word not only saved her life—it introduced her to Jesus. This is the power of prophetic love: it doesn’t expose to shame, it reveals to heal.

We’re committed to raising up prophetic voices who know His whisper, not just His volume. The goal isn’t performance—it’s proximity. It’s about walking so closely with the Father that His thoughts become your reflex. That kind of intimacy changes everything.

In this hour, the world needs clarity more than ever. And we believe God is releasing a new generation of prophetic pioneers who will carry His word with both fire and tenderness.
