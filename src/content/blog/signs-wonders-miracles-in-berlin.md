Berlin is a city with deep history—one that carries both pain and potential. When our feet hit the ground, we could feel the spiritual tension—but also the invitation. God was ready to break in, and we simply said yes. What followed was a wave of signs and wonders we’ll never forget.

On the second night, a man with degenerative vision wept as he saw clearly for the first time in over a decade. Another night, a woman testified to deliverance from decades of trauma and torment. But beyond the miracles, what moved us most were the tears of repentance and surrender as hearts were turned fully to Jesus.

We’re seeing it more and more: God is not content to be confined to church buildings. He is healing in parks, baptizing in hotel bathtubs, and releasing prophetic destiny in the middle of cafés. Berlin encountered Jesus—not just a message about Him, but the Person Himself. And people are hungry for more.

This is just the beginning. We’re partnering with local leaders to steward the momentum and disciple those freshly awakened to the gospel. Berlin won’t be known just for its past—it will be known as a place of outpouring and resurrection life.
