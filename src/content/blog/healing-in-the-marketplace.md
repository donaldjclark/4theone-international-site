We love the altar—but we believe healing belongs in the marketplace, too. The same Jesus who touched lepers on the roadside is still moving today—in coffee shops, boardrooms, and grocery store aisles. And we’ve seen Him do it again and again.

During a visit to a local business, one of our team members felt prompted to pray for the owner’s knee. Not only was the man healed instantly, but he invited us to minister to his employees. Within 20 minutes, six people gave their lives to Jesus, including a woman who had never stepped foot in a church.

Revival isn’t limited to stages. It thrives in everyday obedience. When we take risk and release hope, heaven breaks in. The marketplace isn’t a side project—it’s a primary field for harvest.

We believe the future of missions includes entrepreneurs, baristas, designers, and teachers—all filled with the Spirit and ready to release God’s love wherever they go. This is kingdom work. And it’s only just beginning.
