      <p>There are moments in ministry that mark us forever—and this night in Mumbai was one of them. What began as a simple time of worship quickly became a collision point between heaven and earth. We watched as the Spirit of God moved with undeniable power, healing bodies, restoring hearts, and setting captives free. It wasn’t a conference, it wasn’t a crusade—it was a divine visitation.</p>
      <p>People poured in from every corner of the city. A tangible hunger filled the room. As we lifted up the name of Jesus, the atmosphere shifted. Deaf ears popped open. Tumors disappeared. A woman confined to a wheelchair for seven years walked for the first time. No hype. No striving. Just His presence.</p>
      <p>What makes revival authentic isn’t the manifestations—it’s the fruit. That night, dozens surrendered their lives to Christ. Families were reconciled. Local pastors testified to long-awaited breakthroughs in their churches. This wasn’t a moment—it was a spark. And we believe it will ignite a sustained move of God across South Asia.</p>
      <p>Revival isn’t coming—it’s here. And it’s personal. May we never get too familiar with the supernatural that we forget to be in awe of the One behind it all.</p>

      <p>In the secret place of prayer, nations are shifted and destinies are birthed. Intercession is not for the elite—it’s the inheritance of every believer. At 4theOne, we’ve been contending for the presence of God to flood the earth through the furnace of intercession. It’s not glamorous, but it’s glorious.</p>
      <p>Each week, we gather with one agenda: to hear what’s on heaven’s heart and pray it into reality. We’ve seen hardened regions soften, spiritual atmospheres shift, and breakthrough explode out of quiet obedience. These moments have reminded us that revival isn’t sustained on stages—it’s sustained on our knees.</p>
      <p>There’s something sacred about becoming a friend of God—someone He trusts to carry His burdens and release His heart. Intercessors don’t just react to the news; they shape it. They see beyond the natural and call down what is unseen into reality. This is the kind of company we long to build: laid-down lovers who pray without ceasing, not from fear, but from fullness.</p>
      <p>We believe history belongs to the intercessors. And as we lean in together, we’re convinced: there is no ceiling to what God will do through a praying people.</p>

      <p>Berlin is a city with deep history—one that carries both pain and potential. When our feet hit the ground, we could feel the spiritual tension—but also the invitation. God was ready to break in, and we simply said yes. What followed was a wave of signs and wonders we’ll never forget.</p>
      <p>On the second night, a man with degenerative vision wept as he saw clearly for the first time in over a decade. Another night, a woman testified to deliverance from decades of trauma and torment. But beyond the miracles, what moved us most were the tears of repentance and surrender as hearts were turned fully to Jesus.</p>
      <p>We’re seeing it more and more: God is not content to be confined to church buildings. He is healing in parks, baptizing in hotel bathtubs, and releasing prophetic destiny in the middle of cafés. Berlin encountered Jesus—not just a message about Him, but the Person Himself. And people are hungry for more.</p>
      <p>This is just the beginning. We’re partnering with local leaders to steward the momentum and disciple those freshly awakened to the gospel. Berlin won’t be known just for its past—it will be known as a place of outpouring and resurrection life.</p>

      <p>There’s a burning in our hearts for the next generation—not just to see them survive, but to see them lead in power and purity. We believe God is raising up children and youth who will know His voice, walk in boldness, and carry the fire of revival wherever they go.</p>
      <p>In our recent youth gatherings, we’ve watched the Holy Spirit fall on young people with such intensity, it’s undone us. Kids are prophesying. Teenagers are laying hands on the sick and seeing them recover. They’re not waiting for permission—they’re stepping into purpose now.</p>
      <p>But they need guidance. They need spiritual mothers and fathers to walk with them, to nurture what’s blooming. This generation doesn’t want religion—they want reality. They want to encounter the living God, not just hear about Him. And it’s our joy to create spaces where that can happen safely and supernaturally.</p>
      <p>The next wave of revival isn’t coming from pulpits—it’s coming from bedrooms, lunch tables, and locker rooms. And we say yes to shepherding them into the fullness of their calling.</p>

      <p>The prophetic isn’t a side ministry—it’s the inheritance of every believer. To hear God’s voice is to walk in friendship with Him. At 4theOne, we’ve seen how prophetic ministry opens hearts, aligns destinies, and breaks through impossibilities with clarity and compassion.</p>
      <p>In a recent outreach, one of our team members received a word of knowledge for a woman who had just lost her job and was contemplating suicide. That single word not only saved her life—it introduced her to Jesus. This is the power of prophetic love: it doesn’t expose to shame, it reveals to heal.</p>
      <p>We’re committed to raising up prophetic voices who know His whisper, not just His volume. The goal isn’t performance—it’s proximity. It’s about walking so closely with the Father that His thoughts become your reflex. That kind of intimacy changes everything.</p>
      <p>In this hour, the world needs clarity more than ever. And we believe God is releasing a new generation of prophetic pioneers who will carry His word with both fire and tenderness.</p>

      <p>We love the altar—but we believe healing belongs in the marketplace, too. The same Jesus who touched lepers on the roadside is still moving today—in coffee shops, boardrooms, and grocery store aisles. And we’ve seen Him do it again and again.</p>
      <p>During a visit to a local business, one of our team members felt prompted to pray for the owner’s knee. Not only was the man healed instantly, but he invited us to minister to his employees. Within 20 minutes, six people gave their lives to Jesus, including a woman who had never stepped foot in a church.</p>
      <p>Revival isn’t limited to stages. It thrives in everyday obedience. When we take risk and release hope, heaven breaks in. The marketplace isn’t a side project—it’s a primary field for harvest.</p>
      <p>We believe the future of missions includes entrepreneurs, baristas, designers, and teachers—all filled with the Spirit and ready to release God’s love wherever they go. This is kingdom work. And it’s only just beginning.</p>

      <p>We were never called to play it safe. Jesus didn’t commission us to comfort zones—He sent us to the ends of the earth. And that’s exactly where we’ve been going. From the slums of India to the mountains of South America, our teams are carrying fire where it’s needed most.</p>
      <p>In the last three months, we’ve seen hundreds come to Christ in remote villages. We’ve witnessed blind eyes opened, demonic oppression broken, and communities transformed by the simple gospel. But more than that—we’ve seen people fall in love with Jesus, not just His miracles.</p>
      <p>The mission field isn’t a place—it’s a posture. It’s the daily choice to say yes to love, yes to risk, and yes to the Great Commission. Our teams aren’t superheroes. They’re ordinary believers with a burning heart and a simple message: Jesus saves.</p>
      <p>And He’s still sending. If you’ve felt the nudge, the burden, the fire in your bones—this is your invitation. The harvest is ripe. Let’s go.</p>
