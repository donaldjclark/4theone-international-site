    date: "March 15–17, 2025",
    location: "Los Angeles, CA",
    description: `Three days of powerful worship, prophetic ministry, and supernatural encounters. At Fire & Glory we gather churches, leaders, and hungry hearts from around the nation to press into the manifest presence of God. Each session is crafted to create spiritual atmosphere — extended worship, clear prophetic impartation, experiential teaching, and hands-on ministry that invites personal breakthrough. Expect to be stirred in your spirit, to receive fresh intimacy with Jesus, and to see testimonies of healing and deliverance as the Gospel meets real needs.

This conference is suited for pastors, worship leaders, intercessors, and every believer who wants to carry revival into their community. Alongside main sessions there are breakout seminars focused on prayer strategy, prophetic activation, and practical steps for hosting revival in local contexts. Our prayer is that attendees leave equipped, encouraged, and commissioned to partner with what God is doing beyond the event — as a catalyst for ongoing transformation in cities, campuses, and marketplaces. Childcare and discounted tickets for teams are available.`,

    date: "November 8, 2025",
    location: "Greenville, SC",
    description: `Kingdom Awakening Night is an evening designed to interrupt the ordinary and open a clear door to God’s power. Through concentrated worship and short, prophetic ministry times, the atmosphere is created for heaven to touch earth. Attendees report encounters, physical healings, and renewed sense of calling as the Holy Spirit moves with tenderness and authority.

The event is accessible to those new to faith as well as seasoned ministers — we emphasize welcome, prayer, and practical next steps for people who want help processing an encounter or connecting with local churches. The rhythm of the night intentionally alternates between worship, testimony, and activation so that faith can rise and miracles can follow. Food and fellowship will be available after the service to connect ministers and teams with local leaders to continue the work of revival in Greenville and surrounding regions.`,

    type: "Tour",
    date: "April 2025",
    location: "Multiple Cities — Europe",
    description: `The European Revival Tour is a coordinated season of gatherings across major cities in Europe, aimed at breathing new fire into churches and unreached neighborhoods. Each night mixes powerful worship with prophetic impartation and practical equipping for local pastors and ministry teams. The tour intentionally partners with local networks, enabling lasting relationships rather than a one-off visit, and focuses on mobilizing believers to carry revival back into their communities.

Our teams engage with civic leaders, campus ministries, and house churches to bring culturally sensitive messages of hope and healing. Workshops cover cultural evangelism, intercession strategy, and healthy church planting under revival conditions. Attendees often experience deep personal renewal, prophetic clarity, and strategic next steps for outreach. The tour closes with a regional leaders’ summit to cast vision for collaborative mission and to resource ongoing initiatives so the impact continues well after the stage lights dim.`,

Sessions blend high-energy worship with practical mentorship and breakout sessions that address identity, calling, and spiritual authority.

The event features testimonies from young leaders who have seen their communities transformed, hands-on ministry moments, and intentional mentoring tracks so students can connect with older leaders for ongoing discipleship. Our aim is to inspire young people not only to receive but to be sent — mobilized to start revival movements in their circles of influence. Scholarships and volunteer leadership opportunities are available for teams and student groups.`,

The school emphasizes spiritual formation and character alongside signs and wonders, ensuring students leave grounded in Scripture and accountable within local church contexts. Alumni of the school return to their ministries with greater confidence, clearer calling, and a tested methodology for carrying revival into both church and marketplace settings.`,
